## Issues

### 1. Color Font Rendering (DirectWrite) — Open

> Ease: 1 | Break Risk: 2 | Importance: 2

`SupportsColorFonts` is set to `false`. `SelectColorPalette()` stores the palette index in `_colorPaletteIndex` but it is never used during rasterization. Implementing color font support requires `IDWriteFactory4.TranslateColorGlyphRun` to decompose COLR/CPAL color glyphs into layered runs, plus a D2D dependency to render each color layer with the appropriate brush color. The current `IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis` approach cannot render color glyphs.

### 2. Variable Font Support (DirectWrite) — Open

> Ease: 2 | Break Risk: 2 | Importance: 2

`SupportsVariableFonts` is set to `false`. `SetVariationAxes()` stores axes in `_variationAxes` but the stored values are never applied during rasterization. No code casts `_fontFace` to `IDWriteFontFace5` or calls `GetFontAxisValues()`/`SetFontAxisValues()`. Needs querying available axes via `IDWriteFontFace5.GetFontAxisValues` and applying user-specified axis values before rasterization.

### 3. ~~Synthetic Bold/Italic (DirectWrite)~~ — Resolved

DirectWrite now caches font faces per simulation combo (None, Bold, Oblique, Bold|Oblique). `GetFontFaceForOptions()` maps `options.Bold` → `DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD`, `options.Italic` → `DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE`. For system fonts, the font file is extracted via `GetFiles()` so simulated variants can be created. All cached faces are disposed in `Cleanup()`.

### 4. Native DirectWrite Kerning — Open

> Ease: 3 | Break Risk: 2 | Importance: 1

`GetKerningPairs()` explicitly returns null, delegating to the shared GPOS/kern table parser. DirectWrite has `IDWriteFontFace1.GetKerningPairAdjustments` which could provide authoritative kerning data. Currently works correctly via the shared parser but misses any DirectWrite-specific kerning behavior. Optimization opportunity, not a functional issue.

### 5. ~~No DirectWrite Unit Tests~~ — Resolved

13 DirectWrite unit tests added in `DirectWriteRasterizerTests.cs`, mirroring the GDI test patterns: factory registration, font loading, glyph rasterization, metrics, capabilities, disposal, pixel format. Gated with `#if DIRECTWRITE` for `net10.0-windows` only (TerraFX package constraint).

### 6. GDI MatchCharHeight Bug — Open (needs re-validation)

> Ease: 2 | Break Risk: 3 | Importance: 2

GDI with `HandlesOwnSizing=true` produces wrong metrics when `MatchCharHeight=true` (negative fontSize in .bmfc). Example: Bahnschrift size -12 produces lineHeight=12 instead of the expected 14. FreeType and DirectWrite handle MatchCharHeight correctly. `HandlesOwnSizing` is implemented and the sizing logic exists in `CreateHFont`, but the specific negative-fontSize scenario described here needs re-validation to confirm whether this is still reproducing.

### 7. Rounding Differences (lineHeight/base) — Accepted limitation

> Ease: 1 | Break Risk: 5 | Importance: 1

The shared OS/2 metrics path in `BmFontModelBuilder.cs` uses `Math.Ceiling` while BMFont64/GDI internally use Windows `MulDiv` (round-to-nearest). This causes +-1 lineHeight/base differences on ~7/15 test fonts for both FreeType and DirectWrite vs BMFont64. Fixing this would require either:
- Changing shared pipeline rounding (risks breaking FreeType parity with existing users)
- Making rasterizers fully own their sizing pipeline (architectural change)

Accepted as a known limitation unless user demand justifies the architectural change.

### ~~8. BMFont64 Channel-Based Outline Rendering~~ — Resolved

Full BMFont channel specification (values 0-4) is now implemented:
- `ChannelContent` enum in `Config/ChannelContent.cs` with all 5 values (Glyph=0, Outline=1, GlyphAndOutline=2, Zero=3, One=4)
- `ChannelConfig` in `Config/ChannelConfig.cs` with per-channel configuration and optional inversion
- `BmFontModelBuilder` reads `options.Channels` and writes `alphaChnl`/`redChnl`/`greenChnl`/`blueChnl` to common block
- `XmlFormatter` outputs all four channel values

### ~~9. Space Outline Width Discrepancy vs BMFont64~~ — Accepted

KernSmith produces **9x9** for outline=4 (formula: `1 + 2*thickness`), matching the open-source BMFont logic. BMFont64.exe produces **11x9** with identical settings. The 2px width difference is unexplained from the public source and may be a version-specific change. Content is entirely transparent — no visual impact. Accepted as-is.

### 10. ~~Comparison Tool Consolidation~~ — Resolved

CompareGlyphs logic merged into GenerateAll. Produces 4 fixed comparison images plus per-config comparisons. Output goes to `tests/bmfont-compare/output/`. Supports `--no-compare` and `--config` flags. comparison3/4 show bold/italic with 11 columns: normal vs real face vs synthetic per backend (FT, GDI, DW, BMFont).

### 11. ~~FromConfig bold/italic bug~~ — Resolved

`BmFont.FromConfig()` system font path was not doing bold/italic variant lookup — always loaded the regular face and relied entirely on synthetic styling. Fixed by routing through `GenerateFromSystem()` which tries the styled variant first.

### 12. ~~ForceSyntheticBold/Italic API~~ — Resolved

Added `ForceSyntheticBold` and `ForceSyntheticItalic` to `FontGeneratorOptions`, `RasterOptions`, and `BmFontBuilder` (via `WithForceSyntheticBold()`/`WithForceSyntheticItalic()`). When set, skips the native bold/italic face lookup and forces the rasterizer to apply synthetic styling on the regular face. Also forces the `LoadFont(data)` path instead of `LoadSystemFont` to prevent GDI's font mapper from silently selecting the real styled face.

### 13. ~~DW system font simulations bug~~ — Resolved

`DirectWriteRasterizer.LoadSystemFont()` always created the font face with `DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_NONE` and `GetFontFaceForOptions()` silently returned the base face because there was no font file to recreate with simulations. Fixed by extracting the `IDWriteFontFile` from the system font face via `GetFiles()`, enabling simulation variant creation for system fonts.

### 14. ~~GDI synthetic italic via MAT2~~ — Resolved

GDI has no built-in synthetic oblique API like FreeType's `FT_GlyphSlot_Oblique`. When `ForceSyntheticItalic` is set, `LfItalic` is set to 0 (preventing GDI font mapper from selecting the real italic face) and a horizontal shear transform is applied via `MAT2.EM21` in `GetGlyphOutlineW` (~20° slant, `tan(20°) ≈ 0.364`).

## Remaining Work

### 15. ~~CLI flags for ForceSynthetic~~ — Resolved

`--synthetic-bold` and `--synthetic-italic` flags added to CLI. Maps to `ForceSyntheticBold`/`ForceSyntheticItalic` on `FontGeneratorOptions`. Also auto-sets `Bold`/`Italic` to true.

### 16. ~~UI controls for ForceSynthetic~~ — Resolved

FONT STYLE section restructured from 2x2 to 2x3 grid:
- Left column: Bold, Italic, Anti-Alias
- Right column: Synthetic bold, Synthetic italic, Hinting

Cross-dependency logic: checking "Synthetic bold" auto-checks "Bold"; unchecking "Bold" unchecks and disables "Synthetic bold" (same for italic pair). Uses guard flag to prevent recursive loops (matches existing SDF pattern). Tooltips note that synthetic only differs from regular when using a system font.

**Files changed:**
- `EffectsViewModel.cs`: Added `ForceSyntheticBold` and `ForceSyntheticItalic` properties
- `EffectsPanel.cs`: Restructured FONT STYLE section, added checkboxes with cross-dependency logic
- `ProjectService.cs`: Wired ForceSynthetic properties in both load and build directions

### 17. ~~Documentation for bold/italic and ForceSynthetic~~ — Resolved

Documented bold/italic behavior and ForceSynthetic API across all surfaces: root README (builder examples), CLI README and docs/cli/commands.md (flag descriptions, behavioral notes), docs/core/index.md (properties table with backend differences). XML doc comments and UI tooltips were already complete. Added `forceSyntheticBold`/`forceSyntheticItalic` to BmfcConfigReader/BmfcConfigWriter for .bmfc roundtrip.

### 18. DW synthetic bold strength — Accepted limitation

DirectWrite's `DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD` has a fixed internal strength that cannot be tuned. It produces lighter synthetic bold than FreeType's `ppem/24`. Users who want heavier text can use an outline with matching color as a workaround.

### 22. GDI synthetic bold limitation — Accepted limitation

GDI's `ForceSyntheticBold` cannot produce true synthetic emboldening on fonts that have a real bold variant. `AddFontMemResourceEx` (used to register font data in memory) doesn't isolate from system fonts, so GDI's font mapper always finds and uses the system-installed bold face when `LfWeight = FW_BOLD`, regardless of which font data was registered.

**Behavior by scenario:**
- Font has **no** bold variant: `--bold` and `--synthetic-bold` both work — GDI applies its own synthetic emboldening via the font mapper. Results are identical.
- Font **has** a bold variant: `--bold` uses the real bold face (correct). `--synthetic-bold` also uses the real bold face (limitation) — there's no GDI API to force synthetic emboldening while bypassing the font mapper's face selection.

This limitation is specific to the GDI backend. FreeType and DirectWrite both support true synthetic bold regardless of whether the font has a native bold variant. Users who need guaranteed synthetic bold should use FreeType or DirectWrite.

### 19. ~~Bold/italic behavior differs between file-based and system font paths~~ — Resolved

Documented in root README, CLI README, docs/cli/commands.md, and docs/core/index.md. Each surface explains that `--font` (file path) always uses synthetic styling while `--system-font` tries the native face first.

This needs to be clearly documented in CLI help text, docs, and UI tooltips so users understand: use `--system-font` for real bold/italic face selection, use `--font` for direct file control (synthetic only).

### 20. ~~Core guard: skip bold/italic on already-styled fonts~~ — Resolved

Added a guard in `BmFont.GenerateCore()` after font loading that checks `fontInfo.IsBold`/`fontInfo.IsItalic`. If the font is already bold/italic and `ForceSynthetic` is not set, clears the bold/italic flags so no backend applies redundant synthetic styling. This ensures consistent behavior across FreeType (which already had its own `style_flags` check), GDI, and DirectWrite (which didn't).

### 21. ~~CLI warning for --synthetic with --font~~ — Resolved

CLI now warns when `--synthetic-bold` or `--synthetic-italic` is used with `--font` (file path), since file-based fonts always use synthetic styling and the flag has no additional effect. Advises using `--system-font` for native vs synthetic distinction.
